# ScholaHub-SIMS
This is ScholaHub, a complete School Information Management System (SIMS) developed for my 2nd Year, 1st Semester project.  It uses the MVC architecture with Java and MySQL, deployed on Apache Tomcat. Developed in VS Code. The UI/UX was fully refactored and modernized using Tailwind CSS. All known bugs have been fixed.
